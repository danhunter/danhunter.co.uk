  %p.subtitle Roary's Pitstop Panic

  %p
    %i Project:
    Promotional game for British children's television show Roary the Racing Car. It was designed to be played by kids accompanied by their parents, and offers both a very simple control method - allowing the child to hit either the spacebar or any other key - and a more complicated mode in which the game elements are more interactive, which requires the parent to use the mouse. Implements Flade physics engine.
  %p
    %i Role:
    Sole developer, working with a designer.

  %p.subtitle Fifi and the Flowertots

  %p
    %i Project:
    Promotional site for British children's television show Fifi and the Flowertots. Developed in ActionScript 3. The entire site - images, text content, and layout - was editable and/or translatable. The XML file upon which the site models itself is generated by a bespoke PHP content management system, which includes asynchronous submission and validation for the content entered. The Flash text fields scaled their font settings to allow all of the supplied copy to be displayed, and subsequently scaled all other fields down to maintain visual consistency.
  %p
    %i Role:
    Developer of both the Flash front-end and object oriented PHP CMS.
